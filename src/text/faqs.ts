		`Understanding the test`,
		[
			[
				`for-whom`,
				`Who might want this test?`,
				`Individuals with newly diagnosed hypertension that are interested in avoiding the "trial and error" approach for finding the best medication.`,
				`Individuals who have already been treated for hypertension can also benefit from our test. Most medications have a bell-curve response meaning some medications may do nothing to impact blood pressure for certain people and for others this same medication could cause blood pressure to go down, or even up. This means many patients may be taking medications that are either ineffective or potentially even counter productive. With the guidance of your doctor, the Geneticure test could help you reduce the number of medications you are taking or optimize them.`,
			],
			[
				`difference`,
				`What is the difference between this test and other genetic tests (e.g. 23andMe)?`,
				`Unlike novelty or disease-risk tests, this test focuses only on hypertension and only analyzes the genes most-vetted by research to impact response to blood pressure medications. We also use a patent-pending multi-gene algorithm that analyzes the variants both independently and in combination, so that the recommendations are a result of a networked, integrated approach.`,
			],
			[
				`science`,
				`Is this test validated by science?`,
				`Yes. In Geneticure's retrospective clinical trial, the data suggests the Geneticure approach is associated with a 7.1mm Hg lower systolic blood pressure (top number) and 5.4mm Hg lower diastolic Blood Pressure (bottom number). This is meaningfully better than the current standard of care -- about 22% and 39% lower, respectively.`,
				`Blood pressure reductions like this have been shown in previous studies to lead to a 40% reduction in stroke and 25% reduction in heart attacks. Several well published studies (New England Journal of Medicine, American Heart Association, The Journal of the American Medical Association) praise similar therapy reductions in blood pressure when assessing new therapies against placebo. This is particularly meaningful when our genotyping guided-therapy is going head-to-head against standard of care drug therapy in a very well controlled population on multiple medications. For more information, please see <a href="${routes.providers}">our research</a>.`,
			],
			[
				`evidence`,
				`What is the evidence for the test?`,
				`Thousands of peer-reviewed research articles have been reviewed and critically assessed to develop this comprehensive panel. The efficacy of the test was then vetted with 2 retrospective, and 1 prospective randomized clinical trial. Our publications can be viewed at <a href="${routes.providers}">geneticure.com/providers</a>.`,
			],
			[
				`interactions`,
				`Does your test examine my existing medications and whether new drugs will interact?`,
				`Our provider network will look at your medication list and will promptly inform you of any counter-indications of medications you may be taking. Please enter medication names with correct spelling for accurate assessment.`,
			],
			[
				`which-genes`,
				`What genes are analyzed?`,
				`Genes that impact your cardiac, vascular, and renal function are analyzed so that we can determine which variants you carry and can deliver recommendations for the medications that will work best for you.`,
			],
		],
	],
	[
		`kits`,
		`Getting a test kit`,
		[
			[
				`prescriptions`,
				`Do you need a prescription for this test?`,
				`We will work with your primary care provider to get you the test or, in certain cases, we will contract with an independent provider network. Your provider can register for an account on our portal using the link at the top of this page, or reach out to us at info@geneticure.com to discuss the details.`,
			],
			[
				`for-other`,
				`Can I order tests for someone else?`,
				`Yes. This is commonly done when a loved one or relative has hypertension. They must read the disclosers and complete the the online kit activation process themselves to ensure consent.`,
			],
			[
				`refunds`,
				`What is your refund policy?`,
				`If our ordering physician determines that you are not a candidate for the test at this time, we will reimburse you for the cost of the test. We cannot accept returns for any kits that have been used.`,
			],
			[
				`insurance`,
				`Is the test covered by insurance?`,
				`We are working on insurance coverage for the technology, but at this time Geneticure does not handle insurance billing or payments. It is most likely going to be difficult at this time for you to be reimbursed by your insurance for the cost of the test. To better understand if your policy will cover this test please contact your insurance company directly.`,
			],
			[
				`hsa`,
				`Can I use my health saving account to pay for the test?`,
				`Genetic Testing is generally considered eligible medical expense for FSA and HSA reimbursement. You will want to check with your carrier to confirm whether or not you can use your HSA/FSA dollars to pay for the Geneticure test.`,
			],
			[
				`restrictions`,
				`Are there any age restrictions?`,
				`Yes. We do not test individuals under the age of 18.`,
			],
			[
				`usa-states`,
				`Is Geneticure available in all US states?`,
				`At this time our test is not available to residents of New York. Please check back periodically as we hope to be able to offer the test in this state soon.`,
			],
			[
				`international`,
				`Is Geneticure available outside of the US?`,
				`Processing samples outside the United States is done on a country-by-country analysis in accordance with the country of origin's regulations.`,

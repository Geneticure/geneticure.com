# Geneticure Privacy Policy

**Your privacy is very important to us. Our privacy policy ("Policy") explains the information that Geneticure, Inc. ("Geneticure") gathers from your use of the Service and our Geneticure website ("Site"), how we use, disclose, and protect it, your choices, and some other important information. Before using the Service, you must review and agree to the [Terms of Service](/terms) ("Terms of Service"), along with the Geneticure [Informed Consent](#informed-consent) ("Informed Consent"). Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Policy have the meaning given to them in the Terms of Service. Your use of the Service and the Site and your provision of information is subject to the laws and regulations of the state of Minnesota, USA, where our company is located.**

## Information Geneticure Collects

The specific categories of information we collect include:

### Personally identifiable information ("PII").

When you set up a Geneticure account or purchase a genetic testing service, we collect what is generally called "personally identifiable information" or "PII", which is information that specifically identifies you as an individual. Examples of PII we collect may include your name, email address, mailing address, phone number, credit card or other billing information. We may also collect information such as date of birth or sex that, when linked to information that identifies a specific individual, is considered PII.

### Personal and family health information ("PFHI").

To provide meaningful and medically actionable Test result report ("Results"), we request certain information about you and your biological family, such as age and sex. Personal and Family Health Information also includes information about your history of certain health conditions and your family history of those conditions. For the Service to perform as intended, it's important that you provide the most accurate information possible.

### Healthcare provider information.

Individuals who use the Service may also provide us with information about their healthcare providers. Healthcare providers using the Service may provide us with information about patients for whom they are ordering a Test and information related to their medical practices, including NPI numbers, fax numbers, and the name, job title, and contact information of other providers involved in an individual's care.

### Other people's personally identifiable information.

You may only share with Geneticure PII about someone else with the full consent of that other individual, for example, to purchase a Test for someone else. We will only use the information for the specific reason that it was provided to us and pursuant to the terms of this Policy, our [Terms of Service](/terms), and if applicable, [Informed Consent](/terms/#informed-consent).

### Biological sample.

To use the Service, we require a DNA sample that is collected from your cheek cells. Please carefully review our [Terms of Service](/terms) and the [Informed Consent](/terms/#informed-consent) for a description of how we handle your sample.

### Cookies and online tracking information.

Please refer to the section below entitled "Cookies and Third-Party Services" for more information.

## How We Use This Information

In general, we use the information that we collect to provide the Services you request, to help improve our services and client experiences, and to help advance genetic research and science. Specifically, we may use the information as follows:

### To provide the Service.

For example, to set up your Geneticure account, send you your sample collection kit, collect payment for the Service you requested, and analyze your sample to produce the Results. As part of the Service, we may also periodically review your information to determine if any updates or changes to your Results are required.

### To communicate with you.

We may use your contact information to communicate with you about the Service. For example, to notify you when your healthcare provider has ordered a Test for you, remind you about submitting your sample, respond to your inquiries, discuss your Results, connect you with a genetic counselor, follow up if there is an issue with your information or sample, and provide information about or request feedback on your Results.

We may also contact you to request optional customer feedback, which could be used to improve our Services. We'll only associate your feedback with your name with your consent. To learn how you may opt out of marketing surveys, please read "Your Choices" below.

### To help us improve the Service and develop new tests and services.

For example, your information and de-identified sample may be used to support our laboratory operations with internal quality control, validation studies, and research and development, and performing data analysis to improve our internal quality controls. Geneticure retains your de-identified raw genetic results (A, C, T, and G) at each of the 17 sites that we collect within our software system. However, Geneticure does not retain your DNA. Once we assess the 17 genotypes of interest for the Service, your sample is destroyed, and no further analyses are performed.

### For marketing purposes.

For example, we may send you monthly newsletters, occasional product updates, and special offers and opportunities that we think might interest you. To learn about how you may opt out of marketing emails, please read "Your Choices" below.

We may also process the information we collect about you or from you for the following purposes: (i) to enforce our [Terms of Service](/terms) or other legal rights, including intellectual property rights; (ii) as may be required by applicable laws and regulations or requested by any judicial process or governmental agency; and (iii) to comply with industry standards or our policies.

## Cookies and Third-Party Digital Services

When you use online services in connection with Geneticure's Service and/or Site, the following information may be collected, stored, and used:

### Cookies.

To improve and customize your experience when you use the Site, we may send one or more cookies — small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your device. We may use both session cookies that disappear after you close your browser and persistent cookies that remain after you close your browser and may be used automatically by the browser on subsequent visits to the Site. Please review your browser "Help" file to learn how to adjust your cookie settings. Note that some Site services may not function properly if you disable cookies.

### DNT requests.

Some browsers incorporate a "Do Not Track" (DNT) or similar feature that signals to digital services that a visitor doesn't want to have their online activity tracked. Because there is not yet an accepted standard for how to respond to DNT signals, we and our service providers (like many digital service operators) do not respond to DNT signals.

### Device, usage, and other automatically collected information.

When you use our Site, we may automatically record certain information from your device by using various types of technology, including "clear gifs" or "web beacons."

We also may use these technologies to improve our services by collecting information regarding your interaction with Geneticure email messages, such as whether you opened or clicked on a message. We use automatically collected information to: (i) personalize our services, such as remembering your information so that you won't have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Site; (ii) provide customized content and information; and (iii) monitor and analyze the effectiveness of the Site and marketing activities.

### Analytics services.

Geneticure uses services like Google Analytics in order to improve our services, better understand our clients, and improve our communications. Learn more about Google Analytics' [privacy choices](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en).

## How Information is Shared

This section describes the circumstances under which we may share your information with third parties. For additional details, please review the [Informed Consent](/terms/#informed-consent).

### To provide the Service

We may disclose your protected health information ("PHI") to others involved in your care, including healthcare providers (your own provider and/or an independent provider who may review your information to determine whether a test is appropriate for you), genetic counselors (the Service includes complimentary access to Geneticure's contracted genetic counselors), confirmatory laboratories, and other healthcare providers involved in your medical care.

We work with third party service providers to provide website, application development, analytics, variant analysis, payment processing, hosting, maintenance, support ticketing, transmission of test results, distribution and collection of Test kits, and other services for us. We limit the personal, health, and non-personal information we share with these service providers to that which is minimally necessary for them to perform their services for us, and we require them to agree to maintain the confidentiality and security of such information, in compliance with the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996, as amended.

### For Geneticure's purposes.

*   We may share aggregated, de-identified information (for example, aggregated trends about the general use of our Service) publicly and with our partners (this information will not include PHI).
*   We may author publications using de-identified information.
*   We may disclose your information when we believe in good faith that doing so is appropriate or necessary in order to enforce our Terms of Service.
*   Information about our users, including personal information, may be disclosed and otherwise transferred to an acquirer, or successor or assignee as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of assets, or similar transaction, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which information is transferred to one or more third parties as one of our business assets.
*   As described above, we work with third party advertising and analytics partners that collect information from you when you visit our Site. For more information, please see the "Cookies and third-party services" section above.

### For security or legal purposes.

We may also disclose your information under the following circumstances:

*   If we believe in good faith that doing so is appropriate or necessary in order to address fraud, security, or technical issues, or protect against harm to us or others to the extent required or permitted by law.
*   To comply with applicable federal and state laws, rules, and regulations, as well as law enforcement requests and legal process, such as a court order or subpoena.

## How We Protect Your Information

We use physical, managerial, and technical safeguards that are designed to improve the integrity and security of your information. All information on our servers is encrypted when it is at rest or in transit. All personal information (genetic or otherwise) is encrypted with AES-256 when it's stored on our servers and is always transmitted over SSL. Internally, strict guidelines and access controls protect your PII and PHI that are in accordance with HIPAA.

We take precautions as set forth by periodic [Security Risk Assessment](https://www.healthit.gov/topic/privacy-security-and-hipaa/security-risk-assessment) by implementing administrative, physical, and technical safeguards. However, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information in the event of a breach of any of our safeguards. You submit your information at your own risk. You agree that Geneticure is not liable for the unauthorized release of your PII or PHI unless such release was the result of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of Geneticure.

Geneticure complies with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended ("HIPAA") to maintain the privacy and security of your PHI. If a breach occurs that may have compromised the privacy or security of your PHI, we will let you know promptly. We will follow the duties and privacy practices described in this Policy, our [Notice of Privacy Practices](/privacy), the [Informed Consent](/terms/#informed-consent), and [Terms of Service](/terms).

Please be aware that if you opt out of receiving marketing emails from us or otherwise modify the nature or frequency of marketing communications you receive from us, it may take up to ten (10) business days for us to process your request, during which time you might receive marketing communications from us that you have already opted out from.

### Examples of How We May Use and Disclose Protected Health Information About You

The following categories describe different ways that we use and disclose your protected health information.  For each category of uses or disclosures, we try to explain what we mean and provide some examples.

#### We will use your protected health information for payment.

**For example**:  A bill may be sent to you or a third-party payor. The information on or accompanying the bill may include information that identifies you, as well as your diagnosis, procedures, and supplies used.

#### We are likely to use or disclose your PHI for the following purposes:

**Business Associates**: There are some services provided at Geneticure through contracts with business associates. For example, we may have a contract with a billing service. When we contract for these services, we may disclose your PHI to our business associate(s) so that they can perform the job we have asked them to do and bill Geneticure, you, or your third-party payor for services rendered. To protect your information, however, we require all business associates to appropriately safeguard your information. Business associates are also directly responsible for compliance with federal security standards and certain provisions of the federal privacy law, to further ensure the protection of your PHI.

**Communication with Individuals Involved in your Care or Payment for your Care**:  Health professionals, such as a physician or nurse, using their professional judgment,  may disclose to a family member, other relative,  close personal friend or any other person you identify,  PHI relevant to that person's involvement in your care or payment related to your care.

**Personal Communications**: Subject to certain limitations imposed by law, we may contact you to provide appointment reminders or information about treatment alternatives or other health-related benefits and services that may be of interest to you. We may receive payment in exchange for making these communications. You may opt out of receiving communications for which we have been paid. To opt out, contact support@geneticure.com.

**Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or Other Regulatory Agency**: We may disclose to the FDA or other regulatory agencies having jurisdictions, or persons under the jurisdiction of the FDA or such other regulatory agencies, PHI relative to adverse events with respect to food, medicines, supplements, product and product defects, or post marketing surveillance information to enable product recalls, repairs, or replacement.

**Worker's Compensation**:  We may disclose your PHI to the extent authorized by and to the extent necessary to comply with laws relating to worker's compensation or other similar programs established by law.

**Public Health**: As required by law, we may disclose your PHI to public health or legal authorities charged with preventing or controlling disease, injury, or disability.

**Law Enforcement**: We may disclose your PHI for law enforcement purposes as required by law or in response to a valid subpoena or court order.

**As Required by Law**: We will disclose your PHI when required to do so by federal, state, or local law.

**Health Oversight Activities**: We may disclose your PHI to an oversight agency for activities authorized by law. These oversight activities include audits,  investigations, and inspections, as necessary for licensure and for the government to monitor the healthcare system, government programs, and compliance with civil rights laws.

**Judicial and Administrative Proceedings**: If you are involved in a lawsuit or a dispute, we may disclose your PHI in response to a court or administrative order. Subject to applicable state law, we may also disclose health information about you in response to a subpoena, discovery request, or other lawful process by someone else involved in the dispute, but only if efforts have been made, either by us or the requesting party, to tell you about the request or to obtain an order protecting the information requested.

#### We are permitted to use or disclose your PHI for the following purposes:

**Notification**: We may use or disclose your PHI to notify or assist in notifying a family member, personal representative, or another person responsible for your care, regarding your location and general condition.

**To Avert a Serious Threat to Health or Safety**: We may use and disclose your PHI when necessary to prevent a serious threat to your health and safety or the health and safety of the public or another person.

**Regulatory Compliance**: Federal law makes provision for your medical information to be released to an appropriate health oversight agency, public health authority or attorney, provided that a member of our workforce or business associate believes in good faith that we have engaged in unlawful conduct or have otherwise violated professional or clinical standards and are potentially endangering one or more patients, workers or the public.

**Victims of Abuse or Neglect**: We may disclose PHI about you to a government authority if we reasonably believe you are a victim of abuse or neglect. We will only disclose this type of information to the extent required by law, if you agree to the disclosure, or if the disclosure is allowed by law, and we believe it is necessary to prevent serious harm to you or someone else or the law enforcement or public official that is to receive the report represents that it is necessary and will not be used against you. In such cases, we will promptly inform you that a report has been or will be made unless there is reason to believe that providing this information will place you in serious harm.

**Data Breach Notification:** We may use your PHI to provide legally-required notices of unauthorized access, acquisition,  or disclosure of your PHI.

### Other Uses and Disclosures of PHI

We will obtain your written authorization before using or disclosing your PHI for purposes other than those provided for above (or as otherwise permitted or required by law). Most disclosures of your PHI for which we receive payment will require your authorization. Uses and disclosures of your PHI for marketing require your authorization, and your authorization is required for uses and disclosures of psychotherapy notes. You may revoke an authorization in writing at any time. Upon receipt of the written revocation, we will stop using or disclosing your PHI, except to the extent that we have already taken action in reliance on the authorization.

**Record Retention:** We will retain PHI about you contained in your medical record and billing records in accordance with legal requirements.

**Compliance with Laws:** If more than one law applies to this Notice, such as more stringent state law, we will follow the more stringent law.

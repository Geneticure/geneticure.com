		<p><strong>Your body is unique.</strong> Doctors don't know if a blood pressure medication will work until you try it. If it doesn't work, they might add or try another. This trial-and-error costs time and money. Some medications can even make your blood pressure go up.</p>

		<p>Geneticure's test looks at 17 genotypes and 11 genes* to determine how your body responds to each medication. Your personalized report helps your doctor <strong>prescribe the right medication from the start.</strong></p>

			<p>*We respect your privacy and only look at the DNA that is relevant to blood pressure. The rest is discarded. For more information <Route_ to="faqs">see our FAQs</Route_>.</p>
